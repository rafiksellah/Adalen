  section1:
    title: A cooperative managed by children
    text1: The cooperative is based on sharing responsibilities and everyone's participation.
    text2: Children take part in decisions, express themselves, listen to others, negotiate and vote together.
    text3: Each has a role adapted to their age (organization, sales, communication, management...), which highlights teamwork and commitment.
    text4: Children also participate in sales and money management. As a group, they decide how to use and invest it responsibly, respecting different opinions and making collective decisions.
  section2:
